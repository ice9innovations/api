# Animal Farm Unified Image Analysis API (v2)

A Node.js REST API that provides comprehensive image analysis using 12 different machine learning services with a sophisticated emoji voting system. This API serves as the single source of truth for Animal Farm's ML capabilities, built on unified v2 service endpoints with standardized response schemas.

## Core Features

### ML Service Integration
- **ML Services**:
   - BLIP (captioning)
   - CLIP (similarity)
   - Colors
   - Detectron2 (object detection
   - Face Detection
   - Inception (classification)
   - LLaMa/LLaVa (language analysis)
   - Metadata extraction (EXIF)
   - NSFW moderation
   - OCR (text detection)
   - YOLO (object detection
   - RT-DETR (object detection)
- **Parallel Processing**: All services execute simultaneously using Node.js concurrency
- **Unified Response Format**: Standardized JSON structure across all services
- **Automatic Confidence Normalization**: All confidence scores normalized to 0-1 scale

### üöÄ Performance Optimizations
- **Dual Analysis Modes**: URL-based analysis for external images, file-path analysis for local images
- **Zero HTTP Overhead**: File-based analysis eliminates network requests between main API and ML services
- **Sub-10ms Overhead**: File analysis reduces total overhead to ~8ms (vs. 120-360ms for URL analysis)
- **Intelligent Image Preprocessing**: Automatic routing to service-specific optimized image variants
- **Service-Specific Sizing**: Each ML service automatically uses its optimal image resolution (384px for BLIP, 640px for YOLO, etc.)
- **COCO Dataset Optimized**: Perfect for high-throughput local image processing with preprocessing support

### Advanced Emoji Voting System
- **Democratic Voting**: Each service gets one vote per emoji (no confidence weighting)
- **Service Deduplication**: Replicates CSS class behavior - each service votes once per emoji maximum
- **Multi-Service Consensus**: Aggregates emoji predictions from all 13 services
- **Tiered Ranking Algorithm**: Promotes emojis based on vote count AND service consensus
- **Service Attribution**: Tracks which specific services voted for each emoji
- **Single-Value Modifiers**: Adds special emojis for face detection (üôÇ), NSFW content (üîû), and text presence (üí¨)

### API Capabilities
- **File Upload Support**: Accepts image uploads or direct image URLs
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when individual services fail
- **Real-time Processing**: Sub-second response times with detailed timing information
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Temporary files automatically removed after analysis

  }
}
```

**Emoji Voting Algorithm:**
The API implements a sophisticated democratic ranking system with promotion rules:

**Step 1: Vote Collection**
- Each ML service contributes emoji predictions from their analysis
- Services are limited to one vote per emoji (deduplication within each service)
- Single-value modifiers: Face detection adds üôÇ, NSFW adds üîû, text detection adds üí¨
- All votes have equal weight regardless of confidence scores

**Step 2: Vote Counting**
- Aggregate votes across all 13 services
- Track service attribution (which services voted for each emoji)
- Sort emojis by total vote count (descending)

**Step 3: Promotion Algorithm**
The democratic promotion rules determine final placement:
- **Position 0**: Always promoted to first place (even with 1 vote)
- **Positions 1-2**: Promoted if ‚â•2 votes from ‚â•2 different services
- **Position 2**: Promoted if ‚â•2 votes from ‚â•2 different services (same rule as position 1)
- **Positions 3+**: Promoted if ‚â•3 votes from ‚â•3 different services
- **All others**: Relegated to second place

**Step 4: Result Structure**
- `first_place`: Array of all emojis that qualified for first place
- `second_place`: Array of emojis that didn't meet promotion criteria
- `final`: Top emoji from first_place array
- `second`: Top emoji from second_place array (or second from first_place if no second_place)

**Key Features:**
- **Service Consensus**: Multiple services agreeing carries more weight than high vote counts from few services
- **Democratic Process**: No single service can dominate results
- **Transparent Attribution**: Full tracking of which services contributed to each emoji
- **Graceful Degradation**: System works even when some services fail
- **Expected Variability**: LLM non-determinism creates natural result variation

**Caption Scoring System:**
The API includes an advanced caption quality assessment system:
- **Word-Emoji Matching**: Analyzes how well caption words align with democratic emoji consensus
- **Scoring Algorithm**: +1 for first-place emoji matches, -1 for second-place matches, -1 for rejected emoji matches
- **Quality Ratio**: Final score = raw_points / meaningful_words (excludes stopwords)
- **Visual Formatting**: Underlined words (first place), italic words (second place), strikethrough words (rejected)
- **Conciseness Reward**: Shorter captions with same point values receive higher scores

## ML Services

The API integrates with the following 13 ML services:

| Service | Port | Purpose | Optimal Size | v2 Endpoints |
|---------|------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| BLIP | 7777 | Image captioning | 384√ó384 | `/v2/analyze` (URL) + `/v2/analyze_file` (file) |

| Metadata | 7781 | Image metadata extraction | Original | `/v2/analyze` (URL) + `/v2/analyze_file` (file) |

**Performance Note:** Services automatically route to optimal image variants when available. Console logs indicate when preprocessing optimization is active vs. when performance penalties apply.

## Error Handling

The API provides comprehensive error handling:

- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid file type, missing image, file too large
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server errors, ML service failures

Example error response:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Invalid file type. Only JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WebP are allowed."
}
```

## File Upload Limits

- **Maximum file size**: 10MB
- **Supported formats**: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- **Automatic cleanup**: Uploaded files are automatically deleted after analysis

## Development

### Run in Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Architecture

### v2 Unified Design
The API uses a streamlined architecture built on unified service endpoints:

- **V2BaseMLService**: Base class for communicating with all ML services via `/v2/analyze`
- **V2MLService**: Unified service client (replaces 12 individual service classes)
- **V2VotingService**: Simplified emoji aggregation using standardized response format
- **Unified Schema**: All services return consistent JSON structure with normalized confidence scores

### Technology Stack
- **Express.js**: Web framework
- **Multer**: File upload handling
- **Axios**: HTTP client for ML service communication
- **UUID**: Unique identifier generation
- **CORS**: Cross-origin resource sharing

### Migration Benefits
- **Reduced Complexity**: From 12 service-specific parsers to 1 unified processor
- **Improved Consistency**: Standardized confidence scores (0-1 scale) and response formats
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Adding new services requires minimal code changes
- **Democratic Voting**: Clear, auditable vote counting with service attribution

## Integration

This API is designed to work with the existing Animal Farm ML infrastructure. It requires all ML services to be running on their respective ports for full functionality.

## Troubleshooting

**BEFORE investigating performance issues or service failures:**

1. **Check overall service health:**
   ```bash
   curl -s "http://localhost:8080/health" | jq
   ```

2. **Check detailed service status:**
   ```bash
   curl -s "http://localhost:8080/services/health" | jq
   ```

3. **Look for offline/error services and check systemd status:**
   ```bash
   systemctl status <service-name>-api.service
   ```

4. **Check API logs for service failure warnings:**
   ```bash
   pm2 logs api --lines 50
   ```

**If API responses include `service_health_summary`, services are failing and need investigation.**
